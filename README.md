# Daniel's Game

This is a game program that makes use of the Pygame library. 

## How to play:
Firstly download the files in this repository, store them in a folder of your choice, and install Pygame in the same folder (instructions below). In this game the user controls a sprite and the goal is to make it from the left to the right side of the screen or to the prize without colliding into any enemies. The player sprite is controlled using the up, down, left, and right arrows. Upon running the program, a game screen will pop up and the player will have control over the sprite and see the enemies as well as the prize moving toward them from the right to the left. Good luck!
